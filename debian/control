Description: tool to administrate multiple servers at once
 MultiSSH is a GTK+ based SSH client designed to connect to multiple
 servers and issue to same commands to each server, making administering
 multiple servers less of a chore. There is also functionality to only
 issue commands to individual servers, and to select a portion of the
 servers to send commands to.
